# Before you begin...

Before starting on this course, you should complete...

* [Introduction to Python](https://trinket.io/aposteriori/courses/introduction-to-python).
* [Game Development with Pygame Zero](https://trinket.io/aposteriori/courses/game-development-with-pygame-zero)

This course assumes that you already know...

* Basic Python
* How to setup folders for Pygame Zero

If you are unsure about the above, please take some time to review the earlier courses before starting on this.

### What's New
Unlike the previous courses, I will be encouraging you to create your own graphics for your game.
To do so, we'll be using mainly [Vectr](https://vectr.com/).
You do not need to create an account with Vectr, but it can be more convenient if you do so.

If you prefer, you may also use other software to create your own images (eg. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)).

Sample graphics will be provided as a reference, and you may also use them in your game if you do not have enough time to create your own.
But to truly make the game your own, I **strongly encourage** you to create your own graphics.
