Can you add in more NPCs with dialog?

### Challenge 4. Win the Game

Right now, the game can't be won.
We simply did not create a **Win** condition for the game.

Can you think of a suitable end for the game and implement a **Win** condition?
You should create a new **Win** scene and switch to that scene when the **Win** conditions are met.

### Challenge 5. Scene Transition

Currently, switching between scenes is very abrupt.
Make use of effects and timers to make the scene change more gradual.

<div class="tip">
You can change the effect parameter through actions.
For example, you can change the "size" parameter of the "Pixelated" effect to make the object look more and more pixelated with time.
</div>

<div><br></div>

<div class="tip">
If you use the "Play sound on channel" action, you can then use the "Volume of sound on channel" action to change the volume.
This is useful in creating a fade-out effect.
</div>

### Challenge 6. Effects and Behavior

Play around with the available effects and behaviors.
Some of them may be useful in making your game look better or more interesting.
