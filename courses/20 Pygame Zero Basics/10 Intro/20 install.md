Installation
===
To use Pygame Zero, you will need to install Python 3, Pygame, and Pygame Zero.

**Warning: If you are using a school computer, the installation would most likely have been done for you. You should follow these instructions only if you wish to install Pygame Zero on your own computer.**

### Python 3
Download Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Do NOT download the lastest version of Python. Install version 3.8 instead. Make sure you select the 64bits version. Other versions may not be supported by Pygame Zero.**

After completing the download, run the downloaded file. Make sure to select the option **"Add Python to Path"**.

### Pygame Zero (...and Pygame)
If you install Pygame Zero using the following methods, Pygame would be automatically installed as well.

####Windows
Access the command prompt by clicking the search icon on your taskbar (...looks like a magnifying glass), and typing in ```command prompt```. In the command prompt window, run ```pip install pgzero```.

_If you get a **"'pip' is not recognized"** error, that's probably because you did not add Python to Path when installing Python. Try uninstalling Python and reinstalling it._

_If you get some other error, it's probably because you installed an incompatible version of Python. Please install Python 3.7 from the Python website._

####Linux
Open up any terminal program and run ```pip install pgzero```

####Mac
Open up your Applications folder, then open the Utilities folder. From there, open the Terminal application and run ```pip install pgzero```.
