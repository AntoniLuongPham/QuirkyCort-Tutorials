Setting up the folders
===
When starting a new Pygame Zero project, you should first create a folder for it. For this first project, I would recommend **space_gems** as a folder name, but it's really up to you. If you are on a school computer, you should create this folder in either your flash drive or in your network drive.

### Windows
1) Open up file explorer

2) Navigate to your flash drive or network drive, right click, and create a new folder.

3) Name the new folder (...for this first project, I recommend **space_gems**)

### Images and Sounds
Within this new folder, we will need to create two more folders; **images** and **sounds**.

Your final folder structure should look like this...

```
space_gems
\_ images
\_ sounds
```

We will put our Python game file in the **space_gems** folder, our images in the **images** folder, and all music and sound effects in the **sounds** folder.
