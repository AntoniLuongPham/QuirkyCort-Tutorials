Using IDLE
===
IDLE is an editor for Python programs. There are many different editors that we can use to write Python programs, and Python don't really care what editor you use, it only cares about the content you write. The only reason we are using IDLE is because it comes default with Python, so feel free to use a different editor if you prefer to.
