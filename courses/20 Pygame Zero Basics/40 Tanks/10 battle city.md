Battle City
===
Battle city is a **multi-directional, top-down, shooter** game for the Nintendo, made in 1985.

**Multi-directional** : The tank can move in any direction.

**Top-Down** : You see the tank from a top-down view.

**Shooter** : You shoot things in the game.

Compared to our previous games, there isn't much that's new, but the tank game will be larger and more complex.

New Project
===
To keep our files organized, we'll need to create a new folder for the new game.

### Windows
1) Open up file explorer

2) Navigate to your flash drive or network drive, right click, and create a new folder.

3) Name the new folder (...for this project, I recommend **tank_game**)

### Images and Sounds
Within this new folder, we will need to create two more folders; **images** and **sounds**.

Your final folder structure should look like this...

```
tank_game
\_ images
\_ sounds
```

We will put our Python game file in the **tank_game** folder, our images in the **images** folder, and all music and sound effects in the **sounds** folder.

**Important** : This game uses a wall image that isn't in the previous image pack. I've prepared a mini-image pack [here](https://www.aposteriori.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tank_game_images.zip) that contains the images you'll need for this game. Put all of these images into your **images** folder.

IDLE
===
Look for this icon on your desktop. If it's not on your desktop, click the search icon on your taskbar (...looks like a magnifying glass) and search for **idle**.

This should open up the IDLE window that looks like this...

Click on **File** and **New File**. This will open a blank window for you to write Python code!
