# Challenges

Here are some challenges to make the game better. You don't have to try them in order. Do them in any order you want.

### Challenge 1. One Monster

Add a monster to the game. If the player touches the monster, the game ends immediately.

### Challenge 2. Many Monsters

Keep adding a new monster every 1 second. This means that as time passes, there will be more and more monsters in the game. You'll need to make use of a list for this.

### Challenge 3. Mushrooms

Add a mushroom to the game. Touching the mushroom will increase the timer by 0.5 seconds, giving the player more time.

### Challenge 4. Animation

Animate the player whenever it moves.

### Challenge 5. End of Game Sound

We prepared two sound file, but only used one of them. Can you figure out a way to play the second sound when the game ends? This can be a little tricky and may not work the way you expect the first time. Don't give up and you'll figure it out!
