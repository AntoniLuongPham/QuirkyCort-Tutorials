# Grab the Coin

**Grab the Coin** is a simple game based on a [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com) tutorial, but we'll be making our own version in Python. You can see a video of the MakeCode Arcade version here...

Using Python and Pygame Zero allows us to have better graphics and sound, but the gameplay will remain the same.

In this game, the player must grab as many coins as possible before the time runs out. It's a very simple game, but after the game is completed, we will have some optional challenges that you can try out to make it more interesting.

## New Project

To keep our files organized, we'll need to create a new folder for the new game.

### Windows

1) Open up file explorer

2) Navigate to your flash drive or network drive, right click, and create a new folder.

3) Name the new folder (...for this project, I recommend **grab**)

### Images and Sounds

Within this new folder, we will need to create two more folders; **images** and **sounds**.

Your final folder structure should look like this...

```
grab
\_ images
\_ sounds
```

We will put our Python game file in the **grab** folder, our images in the **images** folder, and all music and sound effects in the **sounds** folder.

## IDLE

Look for this icon on your desktop. If it's not on your desktop, click the search icon on your taskbar (...looks like a magnifying glass) and search for **idle**.

This should open up the IDLE window that looks like this...

Click on **File** and **New File**. This will open a blank window for you to write Python code!

### Save

Click on **Save** and select the folder you have created earlier. Give your programe a file name (...I suggest **grab.py**) and click **Ok**.
