# Catch the Coin


## New Project

To keep our files organized, we'll need to create a new folder for the new game.

### Windows

1) Open up file explorer

2) Navigate to your flash drive or network drive, right click, and create a new folder.

3) Name the new folder (...for this project, I recommend **catch**)

### Images and Sounds

Within this new folder, we will need to create two more folders; **images** and **sounds**.

Your final folder structure should look like this...

```
ninja_runner
\_ images
\_ sounds
```

We will put our Python game file in the **ninja_runner** folder, our images in the **images** folder, and all music and sound effects in the **sounds** folder.

## IDLE

Look for this icon on your desktop. If it's not on your desktop, click the search icon on your taskbar (...looks like a magnifying glass) and search for **idle**.

This should open up the IDLE window that looks like this...

Click on **File** and **New File**. This will open a blank window for you to write Python code!

Click on **Save** and select the folder you have created earlier. Give your programe a file name (...I suggest **catch.py**) and click **Ok**.
