Here are some challenges that you can try to make the game better.

### Challenge 1. Three Lives
Modify the game so that you have 3 lives. The game should only end when all 3 lives are used up.

### Challenge 2. Different Gems
The media pack comes with a few different color gems. Make the gem color change randomly each time it falls from the top.

### Challenge 3. Ship Selection
The media pack comes with a few different types of spaceships. Use ```input``` to ask the user which spaceship they want, and let them play the game using the ship they chose.

### Challenge 4. Multiple Gems
Right now, we only have one gem falling at a time. Modify the game to allow multiple gems to fall simultaneously.

### Challenge 5. Multi-Player
Add in a second player and compete to see who can get the higher score!
